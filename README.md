# BlockChain-Distributed-File-Sharing-Solution
Complete BlockChain solution for generating and sharing files through out intranet

Blockchain distributed file sharing software coded from scratch on python platform. The software encrypts the text data either in
restricted or non-restrictive mode which will then be uploaded to blockchain after verification. The node then broadcasts the 
message to other nodes on the network about the latest addition to list. Prior to encrypting, a node finds out the latest entries
and downloads a copy of blocks to local node. Hashkey linking, time stamping and block indexing and taken care by the software. 
The message in the encrypted blocks on the network can be viewed depending upon the modes it has been encrypted while generating
uploading to the network.

Usage:

a). Download/extract the zip file or clone it to your /home directory

b). cd to /home/${BlockChain}
